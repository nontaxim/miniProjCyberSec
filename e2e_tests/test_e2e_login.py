# ============================================
# Pytest Test Cases for E2E Login
# ============================================
# Test Cases:
# 1. Login After Register and Exit
# Objective: Verify that a user can successfully register, exit the system, and log in again.
# Steps:
# - Register a new user.
# - Choose Exit to leave the system.
# - Log in with the same credentials.
# - Verify that the login is successful.

# 2. Login After Restart Server
# Objective: Verify that a user can log in after restarting the server.
# Steps:
# Before the test:
#   - Register a new user. (Can use testcase 1)
# During the test:
# - Restart the server. (For each test case, the server is started and stopped)
# - Log in with the same credentials.
# - Verify that the login is successful.

# 2. Failed Login with Incorrect Password
# Objective: Verify that the system rejects login attempts with an incorrect password.
# Steps:
# - Register a new user.
# - Attempt to log in with an incorrect password.
# - Verify that the system displays "Invalid password!".

# 3. Failed Login for Unregistered User
# Objective: Verify that the system rejects login attempts for unregistered users.
# Steps:
# - Attempt to log in with a username that does not exist in the system.
# - Verify that the system displays "Client not registered!".

# 4. Failed Login with Invalid Digital Signature
# Objective: Verify that the system rejects login attempts with an invalid digital signature.
# Steps:
# - Register a new user.
# - Attempt to log in with an invalid digital signature.
# - Verify that the system displays "Invalid digital signature!".
